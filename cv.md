 ## Briefly About Myself:
Having started my work in advertising firms, I gradually studied all the subtleties of work. From creating signs that decorated the night cities to beautiful printed products. Also, post-printing processing was on me, which turned into prepress processing already on different devices and large-format printers. Later, after studying all the machines, I started working on them myself. Along the way, having studied the InDesign and CorelDRAW programs. At the present time, I create layouts of labels for products that are sold in many countries.
